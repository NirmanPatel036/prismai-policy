    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date"><i>Last Updated: January 13, 2026</i></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Prism-AI collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our Chrome extension and associated services.</p>

    <h2><strong>1. Information We Collect</strong></h2>
    <p>In order to provide GDPR and ethical compliance auditing, we collect and process the following categories of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Website Content: When you initiate a compliance check, our extension reads the text content of the active browser tab.</li>
        <li>Personally Identifiable Information: This includes names, email addresses, and identification numbers contained within the text you analyze.</li>
        <li>Financial Information: This includes credit card numbers and bank details identified during the redaction process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>2. How We Use Information</strong></h2>
    <p>We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To identify and redact sensitive personal information from your text.</li>
        <li>To analyze content for ethical risks and GDPR compliance.</li>
        <li>To provide real-time advice on data privacy and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>3. Data Transmission and Security</strong></h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your data through the following measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encryption: All data is encrypted during transmission between your browser and our inference engine using TLS 1.3.</li>
        <li>No Retention: We do not store or log the text content you analyze. Data is processed in volatile memory and is cleared immediately after the analysis is complete.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure: We utilize secure, isolated serverless environments to ensure your data is never accessible to other users or unauthorized parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>4. Disclosure of Information</strong></h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. Data is only shared with our technical infrastructure providers (such as Modal or Vercel) for the sole purpose of executing the analysis you request.</p>

    <h2><strong>5. Your Rights and Choices</strong></h2>
    <p>You have the right to access the data we process on your behalf. Because we do not store your data after a session ends, your rights are primarily exercised by controlling the extension's access to your browser. You can disable the extension or revoke site permissions at any time through the Chrome extension settings.</p>

    <h2><strong>6. Changes to This Policy</strong></h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the Last Updated date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2><strong>7. Contact Information</strong></h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at nirman0511@gmail.com.</p>
